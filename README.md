# Iaas-Deploy-OpenStack-OpenNebula

The project aims at doing a comparative study between various open source IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud platforms by developing and deploying an application over two virtual cloud infrastructures built using OpenStack and OpenNebula and analyse the results in terms of:<br>
•	Challenges in setting up the infrastructure<br>
•	Pros and Cons of using OpenStack/OpenNebula<br>
•	Interoperability concerns<br>
•	Challenges in deploying the application to cloud<br>
<br>
This document also illustrates the steps to be followed to deploy an Infrastructure as a Service Cloud platform using open source solution
such as :<br>
1. OpenStack<br>
2. OpenNebula
